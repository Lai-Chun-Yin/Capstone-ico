AGCoin is the international blockchain-based loyalty platform and cryptocurrency (AGC).</p>

<p>The Platform aims to establish enterprises in organic agriculture, local family farms, that promote environmental responsibility and contribute to sustainable development based on green economy principles worldwide.</p>

<p>AGCoin distribution<br>
One billion of coins is primary emission.<br>
All of the unsold tokens will be destroyed.<br>
Testsale: 45&nbsp;AGC = 1$.<br>
Presale: 35&nbsp;AGC = 1$.<br>
ICO: 25&nbsp;AGC = 1$.</p>

<p>ICO Structure<br>
AGCoin distribution will proceed as follows:</p>

<p>ICO = 800 000 000 AGC<br>
Staff = 150 000 000 AGC<br>
Marketing &nbsp;= 50 000 000 AGC<br>
Finally all the energy is used for heating and lighting of the bio-greenhouse and it turns out 4 times more energy than regular greenhouse produces during the warm season. And 18 times more in winter and at night!&nbsp;<br>
It looks impressive, doesn’t it? There's a reason they’re called the next-generation greenhouses.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><img alt=""523bba0115cfa8c.jpeg"" class=""img-responsive"" height=""325"" src=""/assets/_images/56436/523bba0115cfa8c.jpeg"" style=""width:538px;height:213px;"" width=""758""><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For achieving high yields it requires no extra heating while diurnal ambient temperature is up to 10 degrees centigrade below zero. It will be constantly about 18 degrees centigrade above zero inside the bio-greenhouse provided that it was built properly. It will be up to +12°C inside during wintertime temperature will be up to -15°C.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Ventilation is not required too due to the unique air distribution systems. Besides, ventilating can decrease crop yields significantly because this specific air of the bio-greenhouse loses carbon dioxide, nitrogen and humidity – so important for plants – while ventilating. There is no need in often and extra watering for bio-greenhouse plants.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">One of the never-ending global problems which will not become less relevant is food production, so vital for human existence.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">&nbsp;Food security means that all the people have physical and economic access to adequate and safe food requiring for an active, healthy life at any time.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also like to consider problems as they stand now relate to organic food. The increasing relevance of this matter is connected to the interests of the community in a healthy lifestyle, environmental protection and supplying the population with quality organically grown food</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">&nbsp; So we need to figure out what is meant by ‘organic food’. Because most people in our country, for example, haven’t even heard about such food sector and its development.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in ECO, ORGANIC and BIO products in Russia. The ability of growing organic food has not been sufficiently explored.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""></p>

<p>Is it promising to grow it in Russia? Will the international financial crisis be able to affect development of this food sector? And what is Public Policy on organic agriculture today? The ability of growing organic food has not been sufficiently explored.</p>

<p>The solar bio-greenhouse is the solution to the challenges identified!</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""></p>

<p><img alt=""40bfee733cdae39.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/56436/40bfee733cdae39.png""></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">The efficiency of solar bio-greenhouses is very high. They allow both to higher crop yields and harvest a month earlier than in a regular greenhouse. You can grow traditional and exotic crops year-round.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Minimum cost and readily accessible materials are required to build the bio-greenhouse. Once it’s been built, solar energy provides you with organic food throughout the year.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Environmentally safe crops. Vegetables, fruits, nuts, etc. Cultivation of any food crops. Eco-certificated animal production.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">It is required from 0.04 ha to 1 ha to build the bio-greenhouse. The consolidated construction involves living space, storage, garage, studio, and cellar. The bio-greenhouse is built in the south part of the house for achieving better daylight. Equipped with automatic lighting system in wintertime; temperature monitoring system; remote control system; &nbsp;visual indication system, etc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing jobs for the people; turn-key business followed by self-ealization in any craft (weaving, pottery, livestock, recycling, social development, etc.); training; establishment self-sufficient settlements offering a full range of services – medicine, education, employment; realization of the creative potential at the expense of no requirement to work all day long ensuring minimum living wage. Total phase-out of daily imported food consumption (vegetables, fruits, meat, etc.) Bio-greenhouse network around the city. Networks of eco-shops, cafes, cafeterias, lunch packs for schoolchildren and students, bio-greenhouse development project for schools, orphanages, hospitals, kindergartens, etc.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Financial accounts of a bio-greenhouse.<br>
It will cost 150000$&nbsp;to build a bio-greenhouse under a turn-key contract (this is the website of the construction company http://www.sbv24.ru). It is needed approximately 176300$&nbsp;both to build a bio-greenhouse and to buy a land plot having all the communications available. These are small investments for agriculture in view of the fact that it is necessary from 300000$&nbsp;to 500000$&nbsp;to buy a combine today. But it is used 2-3 months a year while a bio-greenhouse works throughout the year producing uninterruptedly and generating profits.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""></p>

<p style=""text-align:center;""><img alt=""8d3d555284e24f0.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/56436/8d3d555284e24f0.png""></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">&nbsp; A bio-greenhouse will produce a minimum of 50 tons of vegetables during the year; the average price of vegetables is 1,32$, the total sum is 65789$. Besides it will also produce 250 tons of biohumus - 43859$&nbsp;in total. Other sources of revenue are seedling and retail margins (because part of the goods will sell for retail prices) - they will bring 26315$. So a bio-greenhouse &nbsp;will have to generate profits in the amount of a minimum of&nbsp; 131578$&nbsp;a year, there will be a net profit of 60 percent.</p>

<p style=""text-align:center;""><img alt=""26c45227af0616b.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/56436/26c45227af0616b.png""></p>

<p style=""text-align:center;""></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">&nbsp; On the results of a year the net profit of a bio-greenhouse will have made 81578$&nbsp;(60%). Therefore the project will pay off in less than three years.&nbsp;<br>
We plan to build a greenhouse complex which has a capacity of 40 bio-greenhouses. The net profit within a year is 81578$*40=3263158$.</p>

A decentralized platform to build Ecommerce websites on the blockchain
Abstract
Elysian is an innovative new decentralized platform that will use the blockchain to secure customer data, facilitate Ecommerce transactions, and drastically change user experience. The integration of smart contracts and data storage on a distributed private network will ultimately provide a higher level of security in the realm of Ecommerce. The interoperability of the platform will serve as the basis for sustainable growth.

Extensive analysis into competing businesses exposes a lack of unprecedented user experience. The current market is not healthily sustainable as advancements in technology become more common. The implementation of Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality into Ecommerce will provide efficient website navigation, revolutionary product visualization, and a new level of user engagement. The extrapolated Ecommerce revenue projections indicate a lucrative future if companies can adapt to necessary market transformations."

                        <h2><strong><a href=""https://sishub.network"">Our website</a></strong></h2>

<p>It is a well-known fact that almost all currently existing messengers depend on either groups of individuals or States, which implies inevitable control. This primarily violates the human understanding that you are constantly monitored by. As for antivirus software, in most cases, it is a virus that proceeds and refers all your actions to the development server.<br><br>
Imagine a picture. You are a resident of China and you need to send a data letter with crucial information (a photo of a girl or a bank document, etc.) to your friend who lives in the US. If you use a regular operator, you will be charged at least $ 0.5. You can use a free messenger, while taking into consideration that it has nothing to do with anonymity and privacy during the data transfer. The one who controls the server has access to all the data.<br><br>
The SISHUB project totally breaks the system (where services have public servers had ip-adress when they can know your geo-position and watch what you are doing) which we have been using for a long time already, suggesting a decentralized block diagram combined with a triple encryption code and block chain technologies.<br><br>
And now a resident of China will spend only $ 0.001 for a regular text-message, while the developers of this project have no control over the data. The system is decentralized (each user of the system becomes an independent server), using a triple encryption code and block chain technology. This system is also able to protect your network from attacks and interception, providing an additional shield of the transmitted data by third parties.<br><br>
As for anti-virus software, imagine a powerful anti-virus software with a decentralized system not only for one computer, but for the entire network which costs only $ 5 per year. How is this possible? Thanks to the SISHUB project, this would be a reality.<br><br>
The SISHUB project is developing an anonymous messenger and a decentralized system for sharing data through the utilization block chain technologies. For public mass all over the world that will significantly reduce the cost of using such solutions, and primarily will make you anonymous and protect the personal data transfer.<br><br>
While users will use messenger he will be pay minimal paying in tokens STEEL(STL) in middle of 5$ - it 5,000 encrypted messages, witch you can spend any time what you want.<br><br><b>1. The messenger</b><br><br>
The transfer of encrypted messages in a decentralized system (each user of the system keeps a part of the encrypted messages of all users), the key of the encryption will be the token itself, which will be burned and transferred in percentage terms of the holders of the purse of STEEL coins when data transfer. We have decentralized system by triple encryption and block chain technologies. They have no ip-address and have covered identificators and tunnels. They will transfer information and change every 10 minutes. It's made SISHUB project absolutely anonymous.<br><br><b>2. System of personal data protection.</b><br><br>
We install special software that encrypts the network and allows the data to be transmitted between all users. The token is also used by the key to decrypt the data. It allows us to transfer files without fear of hacking or interception during the transfer of information. An intruder who might even manage to intercept files from the network, would never be able to open them or use them in any way. The key is the Token that is passed from the first user to the second one. We have developed a flexible adaptive security system which is not only able to identify viruses from non-public databases, but also searches for and fixes the security system and correct all the shortcomings of it.</p>

<h2 class=""orangeh2"">How the messenger works</h2>

<p><img alt=""da60ccadb95d440.jpeg"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/65217/da60ccadb95d440.jpeg""></p>

<p>We develop a messenger in which is based on 3 encryption methods and hashing protocol:<br><br><b>1. AES CBC</b> - Ehrsam, Meyer, Smith and Tuchman invented the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of operation in 1976. In CBC mode, each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. This way, each ciphertext block depends on all plaintext blocks processed up to that point. To make each message unique, an initialization vector must be used in the first block.<br><br>
CBC has been the most commonly used mode of operation. Its main drawbacks are that encryption is sequential (i.e., it cannot be parallelized), and that the message must be padded to a multiple of the cipher block size. One way to handle this last issue is through the method known as ciphertext stealing. Note that a one-bit change in a plaintext or IV affects all following ciphertext blocks.<br><br>
Decrypting with the incorrect IV causes the first block of plaintext to be corrupt but subsequent plaintext blocks will be correct. This is because each block is XORed with the ciphertext of the previous block, not the plaintext, so one does not need to decrypt the previous block before using it as the IV for the decryption of the current one. This means that a plaintext block can be recovered from two adjacent blocks of ciphertext. As a consequence, decryption can be parallelized. Note that a one-bit change to the ciphertext causes complete corruption of the corresponding block of plaintext, and inverts the corresponding bit in the following block of plaintext, but the rest of the blocks remain intact. This peculiarity is exploited in different padding oracle attacks, such as POODLE.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt=""3aa5c16e84cc7ca.jpeg"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/65217/3aa5c16e84cc7ca.jpeg""></p>

<p><b>2. DSA</b> - The Digital Signature Algorithm is a Federal Information Processing Standard for digital signatures. In August 1991 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposed DSA for use in their Digital Signature Standard (DSS) and adopted it as FIPS 186 in 1993.[not in citation given] Four revisions to the initial specification have been released: FIPS 186-1 in 1996, FIPS 186-2 in 2000, FIPS 186-3 in 2009, and FIPS 186-4 in 2013.<br><br>
DSA is covered by U.S. Patent 5,231,668, filed July 26, 1991 and attributed to David W. Kravitz, a former NSA employee. This patent was given to ""The United States of America as represented by the Secretary of Commerce, Washington, D.C."", and NIST has made this patent available worldwide royalty-free. Claus P. Schnorr claims that his U.S. Patent 4,995,082 (expired) covered DSA; this claim is disputed. DSA is a variant of the ElGamal signature scheme.<br><br>
Key generation has two phases. The first phase is a choice of algorithm parameters which may be shared between different users of the system, while the second phase computes public and private keys for a single user.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p><b>3. HMAC</b> In cryptography, a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key. It may be used to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and the authentication of a message, as with any MAC. Any cryptographic hash function, such as MD5 or SHA-1, may be used in the calculation of an HMAC; the resulting MAC algorithm is termed HMAC-X, where X is the hash function used (e.g. HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA1). The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the cryptographic strength of the underlying hash function, the size of its hash output, and the size and quality of the key.<br><br>
HMAC generation uses two passes of hash computation. The secret key is first used to derive two keys – inner and outer. The first pass of the algorithm produces an internal hash derived from the message and the inner key. The second pass produces the final HMAC code derived from the inner hash result and the outer key. Thus the algorithm provides better immunity against length extension attacks.<br><br>
An iterative hash function breaks up a message into blocks of a fixed size and iterates over them with a compression function. For example, MD5 and SHA-1 operate on 512-bit blocks. The size of the output of HMAC is the same as that of the underlying hash function (e.g., 128 or 160 bits in the case of MD5 or SHA-1, respectively), although it can be truncated if desired.<br><br>
HMAC does not encrypt the message. Instead, the message (encrypted or not) must be sent alongside the HMAC hash. Parties with the secret key will hash the message again themselves, and if it is authentic, the received and computed hashes will match.</p>

<p><b>4. SHA-2</b> is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA). Cryptographic hash functions are mathematical operations run on digital data; by comparing the computed ""hash"" (the output from execution of the algorithm) to a known and expected hash value, a person can determine the data's integrity. For example, computing the hash of a downloaded file and comparing the result to a previously published hash result can show whether the download has been modified or tampered with. A key aspect of cryptographic hash functions is their collision resistance: nobody should be able to find two different input values that result in the same hash output.<br><br>
SHA-2 includes significant changes from its predecessor, SHA-1. The SHA-2 family consists of six hash functions with digests (hash values) that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256.<br><br>
SHA-256 and SHA-512 are novel hash functions computed with 32-bit and 64-bit words, respectively. They use different shift amounts and additive constants, but their structures are otherwise virtually identical, differing only in the number of rounds. SHA-224 and SHA-384 are simply truncated versions of the first two, computed with different initial values. SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 are also truncated versions of SHA-512, but the initial values are generated using the method described in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) PUB 180-4. SHA-2 was published in 2001 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) a U.S. federal standard (FIPS). The SHA-2 family of algorithms are patented in US patent 6829355.[5] The United States has released the patent under a royalty-free license.<br><br>
Currently, the best public attacks break preimage resistance for 52 out of 64 rounds of SHA-256 or 57 out of 80 rounds of SHA-512, and collision resistance for 46 out of 64 rounds of SHA-256.<br><br>
SHA-256 and SHA-512, and, to a lesser degree, SHA-224 and SHA-384 are prone to length extension attacks, rendering it insecure for some applications. It is thus generally recommended to switch to SHA-3 for 512 bit hashes and to use SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 instead of SHA-224 and SHA-256. This also happens to be faster than SHA-224 and SHA-256 on x86-64, since SHA-512 works on 64 bit instead of 32 bit words.<br>

<h2>STEEL Economy</h2>

<p>The volume of issued tokens is 35,000,000,000 STEEL.</p>

<p>Soft cap — 5,000 ETH. Hard cap — 50,000 ETH.</p>

<p>All unsold tokens will be destroyed. The number of tokens sold will be increased by 20%, out of which 20% - goes to the team expences for testing, development and support of new functions. The lower budget threshold provides the development of the basic functions of the STEEL project and support of the infrastructure, and the funds exceeding it allow to speed up the development and attract the maximum number of users. The used STEEL tokens (paid for the use of the service) will be distributed to investors every 30 days in proportion to the number of tokens in their wallet from 5,000,000 STEEL (STL) for more than 30 days.</p>

<p><strong>QUASA</strong> is a decentralized system which involves a blockchain and consists of several smart-contracts in the perimeter of the block chain and its own crypto currency. Such an approach takes the development of logistic technologies to a completely new level and ensures total security and privacy in the whole supply chain.</p>

<p><strong>QUASA</strong> implements a full cycle of freight traffic in the functionality of one application, using blockchain and smart contracts technology to eliminate the problem of trust, information barriers and court costs.<br><strong>QUASA's</strong> trusted environment is the digital space of the QUASA platform, where trust is ensured through blockchain technologies, smart contracts and economic incentives for all participants.<br><strong>QUASA</strong> infrastructure: a set of decentralized applications and services, as well as digital tools for building a business on the QUASA platform<br>
Prototype of platform blockchain: - -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;https://www.quasa.net<br>
The functions of the system are designed to protect cargo owners and carriers through the blockchain and the smart-contract technology in order to eliminate possible problems related to trust, information barriers, and legal costs. The target audience of the service operates in b2b, b2c and even c2c models.<br>
Logistics is associated with many aspects which are difficult to be taken into consideration in a single IT solution. That is why QUASA platform has helped to attract experts among the leaders in this field in order to avoid drawbacks overlooked by potential competitors.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""><img alt=""a475f6d44ee5db4.jpeg"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/10081/a475f6d44ee5db4.jpeg""><span style=""font-weight:normal;""><span style=""line-height:138%;""><span style=""font-variant:normal;""><font color=""#000000""><span style=""text-decoration:none;""><font face=""Arial""><font size=""2""><font style=""font-size:11pt;""><span style=""font-style:normal;""><span style=""background:transparent;"">Unlike many other similar projects which have been introduced to the market recently, QUASA is not just a clone created with no regard for the problems of the cargo shipping market, difficulties faced by cargo shippers, or carriers’ needs. Instead, QUASA provides end users with a new model for the cargo shipping organization with simple interface and enables making orders under as profitable conditions as possible with just a couple of clicks of the mouse. </span></span></font></font></font></span></font></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""><span style=""font-weight:normal;""><span style=""line-height:138%;""><span style=""font-variant:normal;""><font color=""#000000""><span style=""text-decoration:none;""><font face=""Arial""><font size=""2""><font style=""font-size:11pt;""><span style=""font-style:normal;""><span style=""background:transparent;"">The product is not going to be used for a “forced” unification of all the processes in the existing and successful companies. Each company is offered to undergo accreditation according to the standards developed by the leaders and experts in the logistics field. Compliance with these standards gives access to all the solutions provided by the service. The company organizes cargo shipping without resorting to intermediaries. Thanks to the established IT solution, QUASA allocates orders so that carriers could use their means of transportation in the most efficient way. Such an optimization helps to increase the efficiency of carriers’ activities, thus raising their profits, and at the same time reduce transportation costs for cargo owners. </span></span></font></font></font></span></font></span></span></span></p>

The use of blockchain technologies and smart-contracts will eliminate the problem of trust as well as information barriers and legal costs, which is described in more detail below.</span></span></font></font></font></span></font></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">In order to transport your cargo or become a provider of cargo transportation services on the QUASA platform, no special technical knowledge is required. After the approval of the moderators, any company can be admitted to transportation. Freight traffic is monitored upon request until the successful closing of the transaction. All actions are recorded in the blockchain, which excludes notrust between the parties; Smart-contract, which will be approved at the beginning of the shipment, will automatically perform a mutual settlement in accordance with the data stored in the blockchain.</p>

The platform, that uses statistical and forecast data, provides the customer all aproximate costs and delivery plan for such services. If the client is satisfied with the main terms of the offer, he places an order for the &nbsp;proposal formation.</span></span></font></font></font></span></font></span></span></span></p>

Coming proposals are formed wihin an increase of price order, that is, from the lowest to the highest price. Therefore, the client can choose the final offer using the following filters: price, reliability of contractors (here the price can be higher); delivery speed; the balance between the various supply factors.</span></span></font></font></font></span></font></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""><br>
&nbsp;Control over cargo shipping is exercised on request until the deal is successfully closed. All the actions are registered in the blockchain which excludes trust-lacking relations between the parties. The Smart-contract which is going to be agreed upon in the beginning of the shipment will automatically perform complete mutual settlements according to the data contained in the blockchain.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""><strong>Second:</strong> The industry standard and the marketplace of smart contracts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""><img alt=""d4b5f5e12665ef1.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/10081/d4b5f5e12665ef1.png""></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""><strong>Own smart contracts:</strong> A key component of the <strong>QUASA</strong> blockchain-environment<br>
Smart contracts QUASA work independently of the platform services. The effectiveness of smart contracts is based on the separation of functional and computing processes.<br>
In the process of creating smart contracts, the following priorities and conditions were met:<br>
- Reliability of performance of contracts (cleanliness of the code)<br>
- Simplify the procedure for testing the smart contract code<br>
- Works on expanding supported languages<br>
QUASA provides a platform-marketplace for the dissemination of digital templates of contracts and agreements that have real legal value and validity in the blockchain environment.<br>
QUASA offers a new model for the organization of cargo transportation and replaces all traditional platforms.<br>
Each module for a certain type of transportation passes a single development cycle, consisting of a number of stages:<br>
- Standardization of the order process<br>
- Standardization of the service delivery process<br>
- Standardization of the transaction process<br>
Transparency and trust in the hybrid block environment QUASA is provided by a combination of technological solutions and authorization of users entering into business relations after the KYC procedure.<br><strong>QUASA</strong> is a platform that connects carriers and cargo owners. Our aim is to build a platform that gives the opportunity to organize every kind og trasportation 'in one click', through freight companies and with every kind of transport. &nbsp;<br>
Comparing to other similar projects on the market, QUASA is not just another blind project, that was created without any market research. We really understand carriers needs, that difficulties that cargo owneres face while ordering a delivery. So that QUASA launches new model of orginizing cargo transportation with the simple interface for end users and ordering service with the most profitable terms and conditions just in few clicks. The company orginises transportation without mediators. QUASA distributes orders in such a way that carriers can use the transport as efficiently as possible, because of the IT-solution that we have built. This optimization allows at the same time to increase effeciency of carriers work (thereby increasing their income), and to reduce the cost of transportation for cargo owners. This system is designed to protect carriers and cargo owners and to implement new technologies based on blockchain supply management.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">&nbsp; <strong>Product</strong><br>
The project team which consists of logistics and IT specialists has developed a working prototype of the service. This enabled us to analyze market needs and compare them to the realization of the fully-fledged project.<br>
- Calculation of tariffs from 18 international carriers.<br>
- Calculation of air companies’ tariffs received through API or from own database.<br>
- System of personal areas, including partner areas.<br>
- Cargo exchange.<br>
- Administrative panel.<br>
The price is calculated with regard to all cargo parameters selected by the user.<br>
The prototype includes basic functions of a QUASA cargo owner, which will be available in Q2 2018 already. Later on these functions will be complemented by modules designed for involving other participants of the logistics network.<br><img alt=""479ed635cb5d9de.jpeg"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/10081/479ed635cb5d9de.jpeg""></p>

<p><strong>QUASA SOLUTION</strong></p>

<p>QUASA - is a decentralized system which employs blockchain and consists of several smart-contracts within a blockchain and its own crypto currency.</p>

<p>The mission of creating QUASA is to solve all the problems described in the previous section and to establish a single place which will not only bring cargo owners and carriers together but will also form an active and modern community</p>

<p>QUASA technologies considerably reduce time, financial, and labor resources involved in the shipping process. At the same time new markets will open for the carriers while QUASA platform will become a benchmark of the quality of the services offered in the market. The substitution of centralized services with SMARTCONTRACT and BLOCKCHAIN technologies will ensure transparency in the logistics market. The generation of the commission will become clear, and prices for the services will be reduced thanks to open and transparent interaction between all participants of the supply chains.</p>

<p><strong>The service will create:</strong></p>

<p>unique environment for the development of the companies and their competition;<br>
trust-based relations between partners and clients, since the service sets standards in the whole supply chain&nbsp;transparency, due to general access to the rating based on the smart-contracts fulfilled by the companies;<br>
opportunity to penetrate new markets, since access to such markets is not limited by information or financial barriers, thanks to transparency;<br>
consulting services and the provision of a tested business process model and tools for its implementation;<br>

consulting services and the provision of a tested business process model and tools for its implementation.<br><em><strong>However, unlike any other platform, QUASA enables its users to use another currency generated by the platform – Quasacoins.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong><img alt=""def99579f5f211b.jpeg"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/10081/def99579f5f211b.jpeg""></strong></em></p>

<p>Business processes which involve the use of Quasacoins will be backed by more profitable and safe guarantees than those provided by direct interaction between carriers and cargo owners. QUASA will provide the connected companies with its currency as guaranteed payment settlement means. For example, if there is lack of trust between shippers, carriers, and cargo receivers, a safer and more convenient option would be to use internal payments rather than fiat money which is associated with currency and other risks.</p>

<p><strong>Quasacoins</strong></p>

<p>We have various ways of influencing the growth of QUA prices: each connected company is a newsbreak, with successful ones being even a greater newsbreak. Each time some company starts using QUA is positive news. We are planning to connect many such companies, and hence there will be a lot of positive news. We will always be the subject for discussion and thus will be able to influence the rate.</p>

<p>The value of our currency will be backed by real services offered by QUASA platform which is going to change the world’s perception of cargo transportation.</p>

<p>Imagine that you had an opportunity to join UBER right when it was launched. That is why we have absolutely no doubt that everything is going to be great. We settle the rules of circulation which will stimulate the demand due to unique services and privileges for the users, excluding the limited emission</p>

<p>QUASA issues 62,445,870 QUA tokens.<br>
After the termination of ICO, additional tokens will be automatically given to Founders, Team, and Bounty members.<br>
The volume of the raised funds (ETH, USD) is ETH 15,623 = (USD 18,747,500 at the rate of USD 1200 / ETH).<br>
For convenience and due to constant ETH fluctuation, the rate has been chosen at the level of 1 ETH = $1200.<br>
The total number of QuasaCoin (QUA) tokens is 50,769,000<br>
From the total amount of 62,445,870 QuasaCoin (QUA) tokens intended for the general emission QUASA will submit 50,769,000 tokens for the sale through ICO at various price levels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quasacoins are not going to be mined by our users or other companies.</p>

<p><strong>FINANCIAL BENEFITS</strong></p>

<p>Carriers will benefit from the simplicity of connection and from the fact that on QUASA platform a community will be working which will be loyal to their services. QUASA system is much more attractive and profitable for everyone than any other existing system. This makes transportations organized on the platform considerably more efficient than any other transportation elsewhere.</p>

<p>For cargo owners the participation to any other platform will become several times more active since for their money they will obtain a 5-10% discount, and this is true for both transport services for cargos and services for cargo carriers. The use of QuasaCoins helps to eliminate most paperwork and intermediaries, which makes the services much less expensive.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>SYNERGY</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to the above-described functions and principles, QUASA will create a synergy platform for companies from the classic logistics market 1.0 and their customers who have never before dealt with crypto currencies. Such intersection helps to achieve mutual benefits: freighters get new customers from previous unreachable audiences and sources, and customers get access to previously unknown to them campaigns and an easy way to transport their goods.</p>

<p>New technologies will help to eliminate problems related to lack of trust, as well as information barriers, and legal costs. This takes the development of logistic technologies to a completely new level and ensures total security and privacy in the whole supply chain.</p>

<p><strong>ECONOMIC SYSTEM OF THE PLATFORM</strong></p>

<p>Monetization of QUASA services takes place in the form of a payment at the last stage of each successful delivery and immediately increases the demand for tokens.</p>

<p><strong>QUASA revenues are made up as follows:</strong></p>

<p>Commission charges for any financial transaction in the perimeter of QUASA – 0.5% (by default).<br>
Commission charges received from service providers – 0.1-5% or, on average, 3.0% (depending on the type of services to be provided).<br>
Income from the first way of monetization - 0,5 % (by default) from each of financial transaction inside QUASA.</p>

<p>Note. By 2023 QUASA is planning to account for 1-2% of the world cargo shipping operations. Hence, the volume of financial operations of QUASA users for purchased logistic services is believed to amount to 1% * $1 trillion = $10 bln a year.</p>

<p><strong>QUASA revenues:</strong></p>

<p>0.5% from the above-mentioned transactions = $50 mln a year.</p>

<p>Income from the second way of monetization - 0,1% – 5% of commission received from providers' service.</p>

<p>QUASA platform unites all the interested parties in a single supply chain.</p>

<p>The platform is going to get:</p>

<p>commission from carriers;<br>
commission from forwarders;<br>
commission from insurance companies;<br>
commission from 3PL operators;<br>
payments for paperwork services;<br>
for consulting service;<br>
other side and in-built commercial services.<br>
QUASA revenues:</p>

<p>In average 3,0% of the operations amount = 300,0 million dollars USD per year.</p>

<p>The price for the services will be fixed in QUA tokens by the time the platform is launched.</p>

<p>1 token will give the opportunity to purchase more and more services. In order to get access to all QUASA modules and functions, each connected company will be obliged to use the set of available services. Hence, the price of QUA tokens will be growing in parallel with the number of users. The use of QuasaCoins will be the necessary condition for working with the platform.</p>

<p><strong>Our financial goals are defined by both the elaboration of new modules and the development strategy.</strong></p>

<p>The development plan includes gradual elaboration and introduction of new modules. QUASA will perform the step-by-step implementation of the following modules: “air”, “sea cargo”, “truck”, “railway”, “bulk load”, and “warehouse”.</p>

<p>First of all, at the end of 2018 the air module will be launched.<br>
Then, truck and sea cargo modules are going to be introduced in the end of 2018 since they present the best trade-off between high demand for multimodal contracts and low difficulty of realization.<br>
In 2019 the company will expand the range of its services by adding customs services and introducing the opportunity to organize delivery of bulk load cargos.<br>
Together with the launch of new modules, state-of-the-art warehouse modules are going to be developed – the authorization of the companies which offer services based on logistic outsourcing (warehouse services and terminal operations).<br>
QUASA railway module will be added in the end of 2020.<br>
Strategy of regional development<br>
QUASA service will be launched in the cargo transportation market in 2018.<br>
Between 2018 and 2021 the services will be expanding, and the overall presence of the platform will embrace more than 200 cities across the world.<br>
QUASA basic investment goal is to achieve capitalization equal to $100 mln by December 31, 2018.</p>

<p>The first operational goal is to launch the application and to achieve net income in the amount of $1 mln by the middle of 2019.</p>

<p>The second operational goal is to expand the application by means of introducing sea and client modules and to achieve net income equal to $10 mln by the end of 2020.</p>

<p>The third operational goal is to add warehouse and forwarding modules and to achieve income in the amount of $25 mln by the end of 2021.</p>

<p>The fourth and the fifth goals will be to ensure the turnover growth of the platform, increase the number of its users, and achieve income equal to $50 mln and $100 mln in 2022 and 2023, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>THE CROWDFUNDING STRUCTURE</strong></p>

<p>QUASA issues 62,445,870 QUA tokens.</p>

<p>After the termination of ICO, additional tokens will be automatically given to Founders, Team, and Bounty members.</p>

<p>The volume of the raised funds (ETH, USD) is ETH 15,623 = (USD 18,747,500 at the rate of USD 1200 / ETH).</p>

<p>For convenience and due to constant ETH fluctuation, the rate has been chosen at the level of 1 ETH = $1200.</p>

<p>The total number of QuasaCoin (QUA) tokens is 50,769,000</p>

<p>From the total amount of 62,445,870 QuasaCoin (QUA) tokens intended for the general emission&nbsp;<strong>QUASA</strong>&nbsp;will submit 50,769,000 tokens for the sale through ICO at various price levels. Below is the description of these price levels:</p>

<p></p>

<p><img alt=""57075fc4a3415c3.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/10081/57075fc4a3415c3.png""></p>

<p><img alt=""d6eada50e9ca756.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/10081/d6eada50e9ca756.png""></p>

<p>The Founders’ tokens are intended to be given after the termination of ICO and blocked for 4 months with the help of smart-contract function.</p>

<p>At the first stage of the launch of the platform we accept only ETH crypto currency, but shortly other crypto currencies are going to be accepted as well. Later on (supposedly in May 2018) we will also accept USD, EUR, and other fiat currencies. The introduction of fiat money will considerably expand the audience of the project, and it is especially true for small logistic companies whose clients have not yet got used to using crypto currencies or do not simply know how to do that. Hence, we lower the threshold for the arrival of new people significantly, and at the same time each new company helps us to develop the logistics market and the crypto currencies market.</p>

<p><strong>Use of gains:</strong><br>
- 65% formation of services described in the previous section;<br>
hiring of new employees and bearing the expenses related to the corresponding development;<br>
elaboration of the infrastructure for developing a logistics market 2.0 as well as developing the member community;<br>
- 17% - overheads for launching preICO and ICO, bonuses for the developers<br>
legal costs and other bureaucratic expenses;<br>
bonuses for the founders and for the developers of the platform;<br>
repayment of borrowings used for creating the platform;<br>
- 10% return on investments made by investors on the earliest stages of project;<br>
- 8% - payment of PR services used at preICO, ICO, and Release stages.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the collapse of QUA prices due to mass sales of the currency after the termination of ICO, all pools are frozen till the end of the campaign and will be subject to gradual defrost. Hence, QUA will be released to exchanges and markets gradually and their price will not collapse, unlike what has happened with many even big companies. The founders’ pool is frozen for the longest period of time – till July 7, 2018. This is how we show that we are making long-term plans and are not going to dispose of QUA as soon as possible. The freezing would have been even more massive but we presume that we may need QUA for making settlements and paying bonuses which cannot currently be foreseen.</p>

<p><strong>Below is the schedule of the defrost:</strong></p>

<p><strong><img alt=""f7a7a9929df585c.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/10081/f7a7a9929df585c.png"">Each module for a specific type of transportation undergoes a single elaboration cycle which includes several stages.</strong></p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Standardization of the process of placing orders, which includes the elaboration of the technical solution for this process in the blockchain and the elaboration of a preliminary smart-contract.&nbsp;<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Standardization of the process of closing deals, which includes the elaboration of the technical solution for this process in the blockchain and the elaboration of actual (real) smart-contract.&nbsp;<br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Standardization of the process of providing insurance services, which includes the elaboration of the technical solution for this process in the blockchain.<br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Standardization of the process of providing additional services, which includes the process of connecting carriers to the service.<br>
In other words, the full complex of services is foreseen for all the transportation modules. Standardization activities are being performed simultaneously with its technical realization.<br>
 <br><strong>&nbsp; Components model</strong><br>
QUASA provides a convenient tool for managing and delivering cargos with the use of various modules for a logistic 2.0. The platform is based on the micro-architecture of the service. Some services can be provided by third parties.<br>
Approximately 30 different duties and extra charges are based on the average freight rate which may seem rather cumbersome. Certain duties are hidden till the last minute.&nbsp;<br>
Since QUASA is engaged in facilitating deliveries, our rates include all expenses related to cargo services. This means that our rates include loading price, paperwork, and any other expenses related to the movement of your goods.<br>
Besides, you can reject other related duties. For example, if you do not pay customs duties or you want to insure your cargo, you can choose the corresponding parameters in your menu, after which the chosen duties will be added.<br>
During the whole process our cargo transportation specialists will be supporting you so that you could find the correct rate. They are also ready to answer all your questions during the shipment process.<br>
In the presence of several in-built operational modules you will not have to pay more than you should. This helps to ensure the best price-quality ratio.<br>
The chart below shows the existing modules which are present in the system.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Advantages Of QUASA</p>

<p>- Unlike the majority of other projects which go to ICO, we are conducting this campaign using our own prototype of the platform which was envisaged three years ago and has been under development for over one year already. Hence, unlike others, we have not only a general idea and a beautiful landing but also an already working project which you will be able to test in the near future.<br>
- Cargo transportations are controlled upon request until the deal is successfully closed. All the actions are registered in the blockchain which eliminates lack of trust between the partners. Smart-contracts which are aligned in the beginning of each shipment perform automatic mutual settlement according to the data stored in the blockchain.<br>
- We cover our users’ risks with our own crypto currency which is going to grow and can become not only a means of protection but also a promising investment opportunity.<br>
- Online GPS tracking of locations with the use of blockchain technologies allows eliminating the risk of hidden damages;<br>
- Own property rights. QUASA is going to provide suppliers with personal licenses by means of using contemporary DLT technology.<br>
- Users can make payments from any place in the world, which is impossible on the competitors’ platforms where only fiat money is accepted.<br>
- We accept payments in numerous crypto currencies as well as credit cards.<br>
- Despite its technical sophistication, the platform is quite simple and convenient for its end users, so that even a child could learn how to work on it.</p>

                        <h1>ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR EVERYBODY</h1>

<h2><img alt=""b0642de61dcd039.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/68734/b0642de61dcd039.png"">Overview</h2>

<p>“At Trial Funds Society, we facilitate equal opportunity funding to individuals and companies that otherwise in most cases could not afford access to justice.” Litigation funding for Contingency Law firms have some short comings as:</p>

<p>1. Lack of hard-cost funding can stifle good claims.</p>

<p>2. Lack of funding may lead to premature settlements.</p>

<p>3. Most contingency law firms are self-financing, and have small bank lines of credit or no bank credit at all.</p>

<p>4. Law firms may rely on fee sharing with other law firms.</p>

<p>5. Civil lawsuits may run from $50,000 to several Million dollars in costs that most cannot simply afford to undertake.</p>

<h2>What is Trial Funds</h2>

<p>Today, most cases never make it to court because of the high cost of litigation. Imagine if individuals or companies could support&nbsp;plaintiffs, whose cases they believe in, by providing funding for them to pursue their case. Crowdfunding websites have gained mass adoption to support meaningful projects and new products that we want to buy.&nbsp;<br><br>
Trial Funds will support blockchain and smart-contract technology that connects plaintiffs with backers. Offering a platform for people who need access to justice, and also empowering the public to fund others in the pursuit of justice.<br><br>
Trial Funds will review every case that’s submitted and post cases that have a high likelihood of winning or setting. This model is already common in places such as the UK, USA, Canada, Hong Kong and Australia, countries where taking legal action is costly. Even if you have a good case, you might not be able to afford the process of taking it through to trial.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Why Trial Tokens?</h2>

<p>Trial Tokens will be based on the Ethereum protocol and conform to the ERC-20 standards. The Ethereum-based smart contract will create and maintain a ledger that maps Ethereum addresses to Token balances and implements the ERC-20 standard. Trial Tokens will be used on the Trial Funds website to access services. As the platform expands, we hope to use the Trial Tokens on a variety of other legal-based platforms.The crowdsourced nature of the platform allows a global response to a very real injustice currently taking place. Together with supporters, plaintiffs, and case backers we believe a positive and direct impact on our society is possible.</p>

<h1 style=""color:rgb(255,120,0);text-align:center;""><strong>THE CONCLUSION</strong></h1>

<p style=""color:#89000e;text-align:justify;""><strong>In conclusion, would like to say that right now our platform is needed more than ever by all the inhabitants of the Earth and the cryptocurrency community in particular. Judge for yourself: the hardware for the mining of cryptocurrency is becoming more expensive day by day, the value of the cryptocurrency is growing exponentially, the existing cryptocurrency exchanges do not cope with the flow of new customers and close the registration of new users, - as a result the market is monopolized and becomes inaccessible to the majority of the world's population.</strong></p>

<p style=""color:#89000e;text-align:justify;""><strong>Our benefits are clear. Every day thousands and thousands of people around the world face the problems that we solve. Our solutions are needed by all: investors, lenders, borrowers, traders and newcomers of the market.</strong></p>

<p style=""color:#89000e;text-align:justify;""><strong>Given the current dynamics of the growth of the cryptocurrency market capitalization, can be say with confidence that with each passing day more and more people are expressing a desire to acquire the cryptocurrency, but in conditions of limited supply, its price is likely to continue grow exponentially. Consequently, soon the only way to acquire the cryptocurrency for most people will be buying it on credit.</strong></p>

<p style=""color:#89000e;text-align:justify;""><strong>Cryptoloans is the first and only platform that provides services of secure buying and selling cryptocurrency on credit. We have developed a mechanism that allows buyers to enjoy all the advantages of buying cryptocurrency on credit, and investors-creditors - to diversify their risks and guarantee the return of coins, issued in credit, or their declared value.</strong></p>

<p style=""color:#89000e;text-align:justify;""><strong>Own token LoanCoin will provide our customers with a unique opportunity to receive a 25% discount on the commission of the Cryptoloans platform for issuing and receiving the loans, buying, selling and exchanging the cryptocurrency. The tokens received by our platform will be automatically put up for sale in order to maintain liquidity in conditions of limited emission of tokens (only 10 million). During the first and the main rounds of LoanCoin tokens sale, buyers will receive bonuses of 100% and 50% of the number of coins purchased, respectively.</strong></p>

<p style=""color:#89000e;text-align:justify;""><strong>The advantages of buying LoanCoin tokens are obvious, but the most important thing is that before the main round of selling tokens, the cryptocurrency community will be already able to use the working version of the platform with the basic functionality that will be realized at the cost of collected funds within the first round of selling tokens.</strong></p>

<p style=""color:#89000e;text-align:justify;""><strong>The project will be implemented by an experienced team of specialists with a strong background in the development of banking applications, applications for analyzing the situation in financial markets and building algorithmic trading systems. We will apply all our experience and skills to successfully implement the functions and tasks described in our Whitepaper.</strong><br>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><strong>A Slice Of The Billion Dollar Music Industry</strong></h1>

<p>Potentiam is a music social networking platform governed by the users where the rewards are distributed between all those that bring value to it without the need for middlemen. This is possible with the use of smart contracts (pre-defined contracts) via blockchain technology, an incorruptible, transparent digital ledger that can be programmed to record virtually everything of value. It's more secure than all systems present today. The rewards are distributed with the use of cryptocurrency.</p>

<p><img alt=""b207e3ab3974a08.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/60045/b207e3ab3974a08.png""></p>

<h1><strong>Our Story</strong></h1>

<p>The founders of Potentiam have worked in music management for a number of years and realise and understand the difficulties involved in promoting new emerging music artists. In 2016 they founded a music publication&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.britznbeatz.co.uk/"">Britznbeatz</a>&nbsp;to help discover and promote musicians which continues to gain respect and recognition in the industry. Together with our advisors we have over 75 years experience in the music industry.&nbsp;Our advisory team&nbsp;is unrivalled with their 4 grammy nominations, and 4 Billboard top 100 produced songs.</p>

<p><img alt=""344bb66f1aca28d.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/60045/344bb66f1aca28d.png""></p>

<h1><strong>Music Industry Overview</strong></h1>

<p>The business structure of today's global music industry has been remarkably resilient during the digital revolution. The capital intensive process required to record a master, and produce and distribute physical copies to consumers is the reason for the rise in prominence behind the growth of record companies into industry controlling corporations. Advances in technology have drastically reduced these costs and yet we find major record labels and publishers at the center and in control of the entire industry.</p>

<p><img alt=""ad237c550e23aaa.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/60045/ad237c550e23aaa.png""></p>

<h1><strong>The Problem</strong></h1>

<p>The current structure of the music industry concentrates power in the hands of relatively few middlemen, i.e. record labels and their subsidiaries. Labels invest around $4.5 billion annually into marketing and A&amp;R, and in turn are still gateways between creatives and potential commercial success. &nbsp; But not only do they determine which creatives are promoted to a wider audience, those fortunate enough to achieve commercial success will be lucky to see 10% of the revenue generated from the proceeds of their creations. In short, the problem is the structure of the industry itself. &nbsp; Its outdated institutions not only restrict growth but also consume a majority of the wealth the industry generates.</p>

<p><img alt=""c34d1e6855755ac.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/60045/c34d1e6855755ac.png""></p>

<h1><strong>The&nbsp;Solution</strong></h1>

<p></p>

<p>The chain of transactions present in the music industry from the use of middlemen will be replaced with the use of smart contracts (self-executing digital contracts) via the blockchain.<br>
This offers a safer, transparent, and cost effective solution. &nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>A social network where composers and performers can create their own accounts to advertise themselves, seek out other artists for collaboration. ​</li>
	<li>A catalog management suite where artists can manage their content, including associated copyrights, that has been created within or outside of Potentiam Core. ​</li>
</ul><p>Potentiam Core will be four main distribution modules.</p>

<ul><li>Digital sales&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Physical sales&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Sync Licensing and P.R.O./broadcast royalties.</li>
	<li>A live performance module which connects performers with promoters.</li>
</ul><p><img alt=""0a6a6af560ffbff.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/60045/0a6a6af560ffbff.png""></p>

<h1><strong>Why Should I be part of Potentiam &amp;&nbsp;buy PTM Tokens?</strong></h1>

<p></p>

<p>Potentiam PTM tokens are the platform’s backbone and will serve as the medium of exchange for all platform transactions. ​ As Potentiam will eliminate the need for middlemen, PTM token holders have an opportunity to directly control and benefit from the rewards of the music industry. ​Essentially earning them a slice of the billion dollar music industry.</p>

<ul><li>PTM owners have the option to stake their tokens in the Potentiam Vault which will earn them special rights,&nbsp;privileges and&nbsp;<strong>(50% of platform fees generated)</strong>. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Because PTM tokens are staked it limits the amount in supply. ​</li>
	<li>The Global Independent artists market is huge and growing meaning the utility of PTM tokens will increase surpassing supply. Providing potential for growth. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>PTM holders can crowdfund their favourite music artists projects.</li>
	<li>Test&nbsp;<u><a href=""http://alpha.potentiam.io/"">alpha platform</a></u>&nbsp;with over 5000 global independent artists onboard.</li>
	<li>Proprietary open source smart contracts. Please see our&nbsp;<u><a href=""https://github.com/Potentiam"">Github</a>.</u></li>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><strong>Platform Economics</strong></h1>

<p>The PTM from transaction fees that are collected throughout the Potentiam platform will all be deposited into in a central location referred to as the Potentiam Pool. Every 30 days the total balance of the Potentiam Pool will be distributed amongst three different categories; 30% for content creator rewards, 50% for Vault Nodes and 20% to the Development Fund.</p>

<p><strong>Content Creator &amp; Vault Node Rewards</strong></p>

<p>The 30% allocated to content creators will be divided amongst articles based on their relative values of Article Power. For example, if at the time of distribution an article has an active Article Power rating of 1,000 CLT and sum of all active Article Power ratings is 10,000 CLT, the article would receive 10% of the share of PTM that is allocated for content creators. The 50% allocated to the Potentiam Vault will be distributed evenly among all Vault Nodes. For example, if there are a total of 100 Vault Nodes in the Potentiam Vault, each node would receive 1% of the PTM that is allocated from the Potentiam Pool to the Potentiam Vault.</p>

<p><strong>Development Fund</strong></p>

<p>20% of the PTM distributed by from the Potentiam Pool will be allocated to the Development Fund. This fund will be used to crowdsource development proposals from the community. Anyone can submit a proposal with the aim of improving the Potentiam Platform in some material way. Development proposals will be reviewed and approved or disapproved based on the vote of Vault Node owners. Terms of approval TBD.</p>

<p><img alt=""5ed594f71bcad95.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/60045/5ed594f71bcad95.png""></p>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><strong>Potentiam</strong><strong> ICO</strong></h1>

<p>A total of 100,000,000 tokens will be minted for the Potentiam platform. Our aim is to render an extensive and groundbreaking experience with the features on Potentiam. Funds collected will be used for the technical development, legal, testing, deployment,&nbsp;and marketing. One hundred percent of the total tokens allocated for our Core Team will be locked into a smart contract with an emission rate of 5% per month, beginning one month after the end of the public crowdsale. This is to create an incentive for the&nbsp;team to deliver, show our commitment and increase confidence in the value of PTM to the investors. If the crowdsale does not reach the anticipated amount, we have a strategy to re-adjust our timelines, development,&nbsp;and marketing process to safely accommodate the outcome.</p>

<p><strong>Initial Token Allocation</strong></p>

<p>The token distribution will be allocated as follows:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>- &nbsp;60,000,000 (60%) Public Crowdsale</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>- &nbsp;25,000,000 (25%) Potentiam Team (Locked for 20 months)</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b>Personalised Tokens carry transactional functionalities, which are specified by the star during stage of their creation, and can also be used as a form of payment by the star in exchange for services received from the community, for example - administrative assistance supplied by members of the star’s ecosystem.</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b>BMT is expected to be listed on multiple external cryptographic token exchanges in order to give an opportunity to openly buy them for those who want to take advantage of participation in the BestMeta ecosystem, and to sell them for those who would like to exit the ecosystem.</b><br>

<p dir=""ltr""><b>The BestMeta platform and the independent ecosystems operating within it, that were created by stars, will interface via industry standard technologies, including blockchain, BigData, Machine Learning and AI. The development of the system will be conducted with Angular, jQuery, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Amazon Cloud technologies, and Node.js. Any new tools that will become available during the development process that will prove efficient, will be considered as well. From a system architecture perspective, the root of the ecosystem will include machine learning algorithms based on viewers following preferences, gamers ranking, and tournament statistics.</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b>The BMTExchange is a system module with corresponding web-page and UI, where users can exchange currency/tokens, implemented as an internal web module of the system. BMTExchange is an internal standard crypto-exchange for create, storage and exchange of personalised tokens. The module will process all the buy/sell requests for different personalised tokens. BMTExchange will be use Ethereum blockchain through API calls for buy and sell of BMTs.</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b>Currently, gaming stars are facing the challenge of negotiations with sponsors, advertisers, and investors: how to define the objective valuation of themselves as a market asset?</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b>At this moment of time, there is no way to objectively evaluate the gaming team as a market asset, which is a huge issue during the sponsorship negotiations for gaming stars who are persistently undervalued. That means gaming stars with a huge fan base make less money than they actually do.</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b>As BestMeta will introduce an opportunity for tokenizations, the problem of fair evaluation of gaming stars will be fully resolved. For example, market forces of demand and supply will define the objective value of esport team and that will allow setting a fair price for the services for sponsorship deals. This will be a significant contribution to the funding of gaming stars tokenized with BestMeta. Also, that would be a great value for the overall development of the esports community.</b></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><u><b>Pitch</b></u></h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">UnA Project was launched&nbsp;with the sole purpose of making digital currencies accessible and easy to use. Most blockchain projects and digital currencies, including Bitcoin, use technical jargon that many people don't understand. These digital currencies are also not as user friendly as they could be.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">We believe that this creates a barrier to entry for most people who would otherwise benefit the most from digital currencies.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Our native currency and wallet&nbsp;was created to simplify, educate and provide people with an all in one solution, while also teaching them on how to use digital currencies, and the benefits that this technology brings.</p>

<h3><u><strong>UNA Economy</strong></u></h3>

<p>The UNA economy will consist of mutliple solutions aimed at making digital currencies accessible and simple to use.</p>

<p>Our product consist of the following:</p>

<ul dir=""ltr""><li style=""text-align:left;"">UNA Wallet</li>
	<li style=""text-align:left;"">Educational&nbsp;Resource</li>
	<li style=""text-align:left;"">Digital Exchange</li>
</ul><p style=""text-align:left;"">The total supply of UNA is <strong>22,512,800</strong>, which is in line with the the total GDP of Africa (in amount, not in value)</p>

<p style=""text-align:left;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;""><u><b>Wallet</b></u></h3>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">The UNA wallet is one of the simplest digital currency wallets available, and we strive to make it even more user friendly and full of features.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">The wallets are available across all major operating systems, and also supports multiple languages.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">At the moment, users are able to send, receive, and mine UNA directly from the wallet. Mining requires little energy, since it is CPU based. This is also vital, especially in countries where electricity is considered a scarce resource.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:left;"">Other integrations that are soon to follow are our Automated Mining feature, and integrated exchange.&nbsp;We will also soon be launching mobile wallets.</p>

<p style=""text-align:left;"">What is&nbsp;UnA?</p>

<p style=""text-align:left;"">It is a cryptocurrency, but it is not another alt-coin.&nbsp; First and foremost it's a very powerful tool that can be used to access multiple services across our ecosystem, which is what gives it value.</p>

<p style=""text-align:left;"">How&nbsp;does&nbsp;UnA&nbsp;work?</p>

<p style=""text-align:left;"">Being a decentralized cryptocurrency, it cannot be controlled by anyone. This is a system based solely on EQUALITY.</p>

<p style=""text-align:left;"">All people, organizations, governments, even banks are equal within this system. Your UnA&nbsp;wallet is ""your own bank"" where your money is protected by the highest level of security&nbsp;due to the 256 bit encryption.&nbsp; By using UnA&nbsp;you can trade with anyone in the world without&nbsp;the presence of a middleman who charges ridiculously high fees just for transferring your hard-earned money.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:center;""><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<u> Circulating Supply: 65 million</u> (supply will decrease exponentially in an s-curve fashion to as low as 1 million tokens over time). This is due to our continuous coin burning algorithm. Terawatt will automatically use 50-75% of company profits earned from DAO entry/exit fees, profit taking fees (like an exchange), time decay fees, carbon tax data storage fees, purchase record access fees (for businesses using our tokens as payment), carbon credits, and even from affiliate L.E.D. sales commissions to buyback and burn (LED) Tokens. This is similar to the BNB token, but they only burn every quarter, we will burn 24/7.</b></h3>

<h3 dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:center;""><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Utilities and other businesses will want to accept our tokens for payments because our rate of deflation is much greater than all FIAT currencies and most, if not all, cryptocurrencies/tokens while also being more private and secure with zk-SNARKS and masternodes when available. They can also reduce accounting costs as all transaction data will be stored securely on the decentralized ethereum blockchain. Furthermore, the more tokens they have to enter into the DAO fund, the more voting power, profits, and staking rewards they can receive.

Terawatt will also create a deflationary currency to compete with FIAT and digital alternatives like BTC, ETH, etcetera. &nbsp;Terawatt aims to tackle other renewable sectors like Solar, Wind, Electric Vehicles after proof of concept is achieved with L.E.D.s.</b></h3>

<h3 dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:center;""><u><b>Method: </b></u></h3>

<h3 dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:center;""><b>1) Terawatt will create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), and also create a highly deflationary Ethereum based currency for global payments. The DAO will be funded and used by Utility Companies, L.E.D. Sellers, Businesses, Token Holders, and Energy Customers worldwide. The DAO will act as a decentralized global mutual/insurance fund to ensure Utilities (and businesses) always have access to funding (which constantly runs out) for subsidizing L.E.D. sales to their energy customers (or for businesses upgrading to L.E.D.s). </b></h3>

<h3 dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:center;""><b>This is a major benefit to utility companies as they want 100 percent of their customers to have energy efficient lights due to progressive grid overload, which forces power companies to build (and maintain) expensive (Hundreds of millions of dollars) power plants to meet demand. They are also mandated by government agencies (i.e. US Department of Energy and US Environmental Protection Agency) to increase L.E.D. adoption in their respective markets. Businesses want L.E.D.s because they reduce electricity bills, increase light output, reduce maintenance costs, and qualify them for tax incentives. The upfront cost was the issue, but Terawatt will help overcome this. </b></h3>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:18px;"">In today's world, humanity is paying too little attention to educating its children, its new generation. And those parents (or entire communities) who are actively trying to work on teaching a new generation face many problems: the inconvenient and not optimized technical component of the process, lack of motivation, laziness, opportunity to cheat and so on … The combination of these factors on a young person (up to 20-25 years) entails the degradation of a large percentage of humanity, which in turn entails the most negative processes on our land.</p>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><strong>FULLCOIN CONCEPT</strong></h1>

<p></p>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><b>Our slogan:</b></h1>

<h2 style=""text-align:center;""><b>""We pay for your purchases.""</b></h2>

<h2></h2>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h1>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">The universe of crypto-currencies has expanded incredibly in today's world. So much so that many specialists in the world of technology see the future in Blockchain technology. Not only are kryptocoins seen as an investment and payment instrument, they are also becoming the revolutionary new way to raise capital for business projects, making this task easier, in times when entrepreneurship is constantly growing.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">However, despite this incredible progress, doubts remain in most people, often due to lack of information, about the efficiency of this new financial instrument; and one of those is whether crypto-currency can become a payment system that allows people to purchase services and products in their daily lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">And it is the people who have this doubt, the majority of the world's population, who want to know whether by obtaining digital coins they will be able to shop in the supermarket, in their favorite shop or solve technical problems in their homes, offices, businesses or companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">When you enter the forums that deal with these issues you find that the connoisseurs and managers of this type of currency are more focused on the purchase and sale (exchange) of them, although some of them have tried to create projects aimed at people to buy products, but regularly only through the Internet.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">In spite of this, there are many countries that have made progress in the field of crypto currencies, and in some of them you can even go to a restaurant and pay with this type of financial instrument, but the market is very limited.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">All these reasons, listed above, have led the FullCoin team to present a project focused on microeconomics. Our main purpose is to create a tool that allows people to carry crypto coins on their mobile phones and enter any establishment and pay with them; no matter what they buy, from their food to ordering a tow truck to tow their vehicle or acquiring services from a plumber to solve a problem in their home or office.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Given that the vast majority of the world's population still does not know how to manage a crypto-currency portfolio and, furthermore, is not yet familiar with the process to follow to make payments with it, for this reason we are developing a points system, which can be exchanged for FLC. This implementation does not require the user to know about cryptocoins since it will be designed so that without any knowledge about this instrument, people can exchange their points for FLC and buy in any commercial establishment. This tool will convert FullCoin into the digital currency with the world's largest market in no more than 10 years.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">What we will present below is a clear focus that we intend to create a precedent, with a long-term business plan to make FullCoin the world's most popular crypto-currency for purchasing products and services in any type of business or enterprise.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">To achieve this we have studied hundreds of INITIAL CURRENCY OFFER (ICO) projects, analysing their strengths and weaknesses. We have spent hundreds of hours listening to people, studying their opinions and exploring what they want the cryptocoins to be. We believe that technology should be at the service of people and Blockchain should be no exception.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">We will take this approach in three ways. The first is to our investors, whom we intend to consider as our shareholders, distributing among them a percentage of the profits generated by the business project that will emerge from the ICO FullCoin; the second is to the consumers of the services that will be offered through our PPP in all the countries of the world where our offices will be located and the products and services offered by our affiliated business network throughout the world.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">That's why we have made sure to choose one of the best teams of developers in Latin America, to achieve the best crypto currencies project that has been done so far. We do not intend to copy paradigms from previous ICOS, we have created an original one, with different sales deadlines and never applied themes. &nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">It is our main purpose during the sale of FLC tokens to reward our investors with the best bonus package ever seen, to make them part of the project and, above all, to create a transparent communication channel that allows them to obtain all the necessary information on how the entire work plan is being developed.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">To meet our objectives, we will develop the TecniFull APP, through which people will be able to request a wide range of services (this app is in the development phase of its Beta version). In addition, we will create a fund to finance new technological projects, with which we will promote entrepreneurship; we will found the Members Club, which will guarantee the distribution of a percentage of the benefits obtained in the business project that arises from the ICO FullCoin; a debit card will be issued, which will be used by investors to request their FLC balance in dollars when they deem it relevant, we have begun to create the largest network of physical and online businesses that receive payments with FullCoin and adopt our points and discounts system (including discount card) and, finally, our affiliate program that will give a 10% bonus for referrals during the FLC public sale process.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Next we present the complete and meticulous development of this fascinating crypto-business project of which we invite you to be a part.</p>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><strong>FULLCOIN THE CRYPTOCURRENCY OF MICROECONOMICS</strong></h1>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">We have christened FullCoin as the cryptocurrency of microeconomics, as its main purpose is to become part of the everyday life of people, their daily purchases, their holidays and their purchases of products and services. &nbsp;We want this to be a companion of the people in your life. A percentage of the funds acquired will be used to create a system of compensation through points, so that each time the person acquires a service through our App TecniFull or in the network of businesses and affiliated companies, can accumulate and exchange them for FLC and then use them to pay for services and products purchased.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">That people arrive at the mall, supermarket, store, hardware store, store, etc. and pay with FLC will be our priority, so we will negotiate with merchants of all types to distribute our discount card, through which, customers accumulate points that will be exchanged for FLC and at the same time, these will serve to pay future purchases.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">We will organize events to educate, inform and introduce people to the process of crypto-currency and invite them to take FullCoin as part of their daily lives. Every month our investors will receive a calendar of activities in different cities around the world, which will be organized by our marketing team.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">A whole schedule of work has been designed to bring our cryptocurrency to the people through our points system. &nbsp;These will be purchased each time a customer purchases a service through our App or a product in the network of businesses and affiliated companies. &nbsp;This system will ensure that people start using FullCoin, as they will be able to exchange their accumulated points for FLC and then buy with them what they want.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">With the system of points, discounts and exchange in our App TecniFull and the web platform, we have guaranteed the access of people to our token and that it is an instrument of purchase, easy to use and safe for the user.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">In addition, it is guaranteed to create the largest market for such a currency, as the project is designed to be friendly to people who do not even know about kryptonite. This is because we are convinced that the growth of any currency in the world depends a lot on the size of its market and how many transactions can be made with it in a given period of time.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><strong>ISSUES RAISED</strong></h1>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Krypto currencies are changing the traditional financial system, to such an extent that all the world's media are already talking about them and millions of people around the world are generating wealth with these new economic instruments. In the case of Latin America in Venezuela, he developed his own crypto currency and a presidential candidate in Colombia announced that he would finance his campaign with crypto coins. However, many points remain to be clarified with regard to this system.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Such is the case that cryptocurrencies are not yet seriously focused on microeconomics. Unfortunately, we cannot use them to purchase the products of our daily lives. This makes a large percentage of the world's population suspicious of their efficiency and permanence over time.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">People want to feel that they can spend with crypto coins, because that's when they'll understand that it's money. Of course, this is also due to a lack of information and education on the correct way to use them and how they work. This same lack makes the traditional merchants not decide to receive them as payment instruments in their businesses. It is the fundamental task of our team to change this perception.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">This is the main weakness that we see in cryptocurrencies and is that there has not been a serious project aimed at turning them into a payment instrument for products and services in the home, office, business or enterprise (microeconomics) economy. In certain attempts to direct them to these tasks, they have focused only on online businesses, forgetting the wide range of physical commercial institutions</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Another weakness is the system of exchanging crypto coins for traditional money. It is very difficult for a person who does not have a lot of information to enter an Exchange and exchange currencies of this category and, above all, to be able to make the change to conventional money, such as the dollar, euro or the local currency of his country. Although, for those who have specialized in crypto-currency, it is much easier, there is still much room for improvement to make these processes less complicated</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Buscar capital creando una crypto currencies, utilizando tecnologías blockchain como la de Ethereum, entre otras, está en boga y va en aumento. Pero los proyectos de este tipo que ofrezcan beneficios más allá de una cantidad de tokens a cambio de otras criptomonedas o dinero tradicional, son muy pocos o casi ninguno. Lo que hace la inversión en los mismos altamente riesgosa, ya que si el token que sustenta el proyecto no sube de precio o disminuye, entonces, la inversión se perderá.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><br>
These are the reasons we have evaluated for identifying the following problems:</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">1.- Crypto currencies are not focused on the purchase of services.<br>
2.- They are not intended for the purchase of products in physical businesses.<br>
3.- It is complicated the process of exchanging crypto currencies for traditional money and obtaining it physically, quickly, for people who do not know the universe of crypto.<br>
4.- The investment in most ICOs is not guaranteed beyond the tokens received.<br>
5.- Entrepreneurship has very little support in the world.<br>
There is no simple mechanism that encourages people to use crypto-currency in their daily lives.<br>
To these and other problems, related to the use of crypto currencies, FullCoin brings a set of concrete solutions to be definitively solved. This is what makes it a large project and will bring great results for your investors.</p>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><strong>SOLUTIONS</strong></h1>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">In the previous section, we presented a series of problems that we found based on our studies and analysis of the crypto-currency and ICOs market. For this reason, we presented our investors with the solutions that we intend to develop to solve them definitively and permanently.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Faced with the constant complaint that the common public cannot buy services with crypto coins, FullCoin brings as an alternative the App (Android and iOS) TecniFull, with which technicians and professionals from different areas will connect with users seeking solutions to the problems they face in their homes, offices, businesses or companies. In addition, it will connect road assistance services, with which users can be helped in the event of damage to their vehicles or accidents.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">This App will concentrate a wide range of services that can be purchased with FullCoin from anywhere in the world, as it will be gradually operational in most countries of the world.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">In addition to FullCoin, in the App you can pay with other cryptocurrencies or with traditional money.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">In order for FullCoin to be a payment instrument to acquire products in any business, we are working on the construction of a network of physical and virtual businesses that will accept it as a payment system (affiliated businesses). For this reason we will create a software integrated to the Tecnifull App, through which the user will receive a discount card that will allow them to buy at better prices in the affiliated businesses. This system will have a system that will generate points for the volume of purchases to the user.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">The user generated points can be exchanged in the same App by FullCoin and, later, you will have the option to use them to purchase any product or service in our network of businesses and affiliated companies worldwide. This system will be designed in such a way that users can easily exchange points for FLC and FullCoin points for traditional money in the case that it is worth it.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">To facilitate the incorporation of businesses to this network we will provide a software through which the affiliate can request at any time the exchange of FullCoin for dollars, euros or their local currency that they will receive in their debit card, with which they can use their money at anytime and anywhere in the world. This will make it easier to switch from FLC to other traditional currencies or other crypto currencies quickly and effectively.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">All these solutions that FullCoin will provide will be guaranteed for investors when they acquire our token, since for that we have contemplated a Members Club, through which all FLC buyers will receive a portion of the benefits produced by the business projects that will be developed from our ICO. &nbsp;The percentage of profits to be distributed can be found in the member club section of our website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">This is the reason why the investment made in FullCoin will not only generate benefits for the increase of its price (which is more than guaranteed with the development of our project) but will be obtained proportionally to its purchase made in the pre-sale and public sale of tokens, since it will generate a calculated profit of a percentage of the profits provided by the business project that will arise through our App TecniFull and those that are financed by the fund for entrepreneurs, to belong to the Members Club.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Our main business project is TecniFull, but we will also proceed to create a fund to finance projects presented by young entrepreneurs. &nbsp;These projects must be focused on technology and must guarantee that FullCoin itself is allowed as a payment instrument for the goods, products or services that are intended to be offered; with this we provide a solution to the lack of financing for entrepreneurs. &nbsp;In addition, the system of discounts and rewards will be installed in each of the businesses affiliated to our system.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">As for the financing fund for entrepreneurs, the projects presented by the entrepreneurs will be evaluated by a team of specialists duly selected by FullCoin's directors, who will determine, through a thorough examination, which of them will be eligible for financing.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">FullCoin will also receive a shareholding percentage of these projects, thNus guaranteeing more income for the members of the club of members of this entity.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">In short, our project includes an App with offers of a wide range of services that can be paid with FullCoin and that will have an integrated system of exchange of crypto coins for traditional money, in addition to generating points for purchases in the network of affiliated businesses. &nbsp;Our partners and users of the App will have access to a debit card and a discount card that will allow them to exchange their tokens for dollars and their points for FLC, respectively. &nbsp;Finally, we will have the most innovative financing fund for entrepreneurs in the area of technology and, above all, we will guarantee their investment beyond the intrinsic value of the currency with the Members Club that will allow them to enjoy a percentage of the profits from our business projects.</p>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><strong>TECNIFULL</strong></h1>

<h2><strong><img alt=""04857dea988ac8a.png"" src=""https://www.kickico.com/assets/_images/77921/04857dea988ac8a.png"">1.- What is TecniFull?</strong></h2>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">TecniFull is an App that will fulfill the fundamental objective of connecting technicians and professionals from different areas with the user, who may request the assistance of one of these to solve any technical, electrical, construction, electronic, health, roadside assistance or other problems that may arise in the home, office, business or company. &nbsp;The same will have FLC as payment instrument and will have a system of compensation points and discounts for the use of the same, these points can be exchanged by FLC and in turn, will be used to make purchases in our network of affiliated businesses or to pay services requested in the same App.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">TecniFull will have integrated a FullCoin exchange system for traditional money that will be connected to the debit and discount card, which will be provided to users and ICO investment partners.</p>

<h2><strong>2.- Objectives</strong></h2>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">a.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be a tool that provides the opportunity for thousands of technicians and trained professionals to be targeted by millions of users who require their services in the world through the App.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">b.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To put in the hands of the user an App that allows them to find quick solutions to technical problems, health, road assistance, among others that may arise in their daily lives.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">c.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Connect thousands of businesses and companies that offer road assistance, health and other services with the user who requires it.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">d.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Encourage the payment of these services with FLC.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">e.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Facilitate the rapid and efficient exchange of FLCs for traditional money</p>

<h2><strong>3.- Countries where TecniFull will be available</strong></h2>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">According to our work schedule TecniFull will be in almost every country in the world. Of course, that will happen gradually.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">In 2019, the App will be launched in the Dominican Republic, where we will launch a pilot plan that will help us apply it in other countries where it will be available.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">In this same year we will work to expand it throughout the Caribbean, taking into account the experience we will have of its operation in the Dominican Republic.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">It is scheduled to be activated throughout Latin America in 2020.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">In 2021 we will arrive in the United States and Canada.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">And in 2022 we will extend it to Europe and some countries in Asia.</p>

<h2><strong>4.- Physical and Business Structure</strong></h2>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">In each country where TecniFull is operating, there will be a central office where our human capital will be housed in order to ensure the correct functioning of the business system that we will implement. Not only with the App, but also with everything related to the FullCoin project in general.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">At first, the central office will be housed in a building to be rented, while the team identifies the most appropriate one to be acquired where the headquarters of the business institution related to the entire project will be permanently and permanently installed. This headquarters, once acquired, will become part of the assets that we intend to acquire in the development of this great project. That is why FullCoin has great potential to become a creator of real estate assets around the world.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">In each city of the country where TecniFull is put into operation, offices will be set up, which will be attached to the headquarters, thus guaranteeing a faithful supervision of the correct functioning of the App and of all the business gear that will emanate from our ICO.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Our investors will be invited to the inauguration of these offices and will be duly informed of all the processes and steps we will be taking to achieve the objectives we have set for ourselves through our web platform.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Each headquarters will be headed by a National Executive President and the city offices by a zone vice president. &nbsp;They will be in charge of the management of TecniFull in their geographical area.</p>

<h2><strong>5.- Payment System.</strong></h2>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">TecniFull will be an application that will have several integrated payment systems, however, its priority will be to receive payments with cryptom currencies, basically FLC. This will be guaranteed by the points and discount system. &nbsp;The customer will have the option to pay with traditional methods (Credit Card, Paypal or cash payment), however, will have a system that will allow payment with crypto coins and the fast and effective change from traditional money to crypto coins and vice versa.</p>

<h2><strong>6.- Points and Discounts System.</strong></h2>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">The points and discount system will be the fundamental tool to ensure that users, investors and all the personnel who are part of this project can obtain benefits from it.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">TecniFull users and investors of our ICO will receive an international discount card that they will be able to use in their purchases in the network of businesses and companies affiliated to FullCoin, to obtain products and services with more affordable prices. This will guarantee you substantial discounts on each of the services and products purchased by the person who owns it, depending on the contractual agreement we reach with the business or affiliated company.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">In addition to discounts when making purchases, the discount card user will accumulate points proportional to the volume purchased. These points can be exchanged every month by FullCoins that can be used to purchase services and products in the network of businesses and affiliated companies.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">The TecniFull App will also provide points to customers who request assistance through it. &nbsp;These points can be exchanged by FLC, which in turn can be used to pay for services requested later in the same tool.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">The user will have the opportunity to exchange the points for FLC and then for dollars that they will receive in the FullCoin debit card, in case they do not use them in their daily purchases.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Likewise, technicians and professionals connected to the App will receive points for services rendered. &nbsp;They can also exchange it for FLC to make purchases in our network of affiliated businesses worldwide.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Our investors will also receive the discount card and will obtain the same benefits, mentioned above, when making their purchases in our affiliate network or requesting services from our App.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">This is one more way to make money with our project by investing in the pre-sale and public sale of ICO FullCoin</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">This will allow us to raise the quality of our services and our staff, as the goal will always be to improve the level of customer service.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><strong>FUNDING FUND</strong></h1>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Ever since the idea of FullCoin emerged, we have been thinking about a serious problem that entrepreneurs have today: when they generate an idea and turn it into a project, they often do not have enough or no funds to move it forward. &nbsp;In view of this, we decided to bring a solution to this painful situation.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">A percentage of the capital raised at ICO FullCoin will be converted into a financing fund for new technological projects that aim to use blockchain technology and are focused on the development and growth of crypto coins worldwide.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">To be eligible for this funding, projects must be submitted to the FullCoin team, who will thoroughly evaluate, together with specialists in the topics covered by the projects, to determine which ones are eligible to receive funding from the institution.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><br>
All this process will be done in a transparent way and the process of project delivery, selection and approval of funds will be published on the FullCoin website, so that all our investors will be duly informed of what is being done with the money raised.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">The selected projects must give priority to FLC in the field of crypto coins payments and will make available to us a percentage of their shares. This will ensure that FLC's business project continues to grow for the benefit of our investors. In addition, it will increase the network of businesses and affiliated companies that will receive FullCoin as their payment method worldwide.</p>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><strong>NETWORK OF PHYSICAL AND ONLINE BUSINESSES THAT WILL RECEIVE FULLCOIN PAYMENTS</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>1.- How will the network work?</strong></h2>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">FullCoin will create a network of physical and online businesses that will act as affiliates. These will offer customers the opportunity to purchase the FullCoin discount card, with which they will offer discounts ranging from 5% to 20% on their purchases, depending on the affiliation agreement we reach with each of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">With this card you will be able to purchase any product or service from businesses and affiliated companies and receive rewards in points, proportional to the amount of money you spend. &nbsp;These points will be exchanged on our web platform by FullCoins, which will then be used to purchase items or services or to exchange them for dollars.</p>

<h2><strong>2.- Lovendotó</strong></h2>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Lovendotó is the first online store to receive payments with FullCoin and will implement the point compensation system for customers who buy from it. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
This online store will be open to the public at the beginning of this ICO and in it, you can also pay with Bitcoin and other crypto currencies, always giving priority to FLC through your discount card.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">It is a virtual store where different products are sold, such as women's, men's and children's clothing, footwear, handbags, jewelry, accessories and more. &nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">This platform is designed to buy from anywhere in the world and customers can receive at the door of their home or office, with the guarantee of companies such as UPS, FEDEX, VIMENPAQ, INPOSDOM, among others.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">In the same one the clients will be able to acquire any of the merchandise that we sell and for the volume of purchase they will receive points that can be exchanged by FullCoin and these in turn can be used to buy any of our products.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><strong>You can buy clothes, shoes, jewelry, accessories, computer accessories, handbags, among other products from October 1st, 2018 onwards at https://lovendoto.com.do and pay with FullCoin from anywhere in the world and receive them at your home or office door.</strong></p>

<h2 style=""text-align:justify;""><strong>You can visit the store at http://lovendoto.com.do/</strong></h2>

<p><img alt=""ded8756fdedbd0e.png"" src=""https://www.kickico.com/assets/_images/77921/ded8756fdedbd0e.png""></p>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><strong>FULLCOIN MEMBERSHIP CLUB</strong></h1>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">The FullCoin Member Club is the platform through which our investors will be able to participate in the distribution of 10% of the profits obtained from the business projects promoted and financed with the funds raised in our ICO.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">By simply participating as an investor in the pre-sale or public sale you become a candidate to register on our Membership Club platform and receive an annual bonus proportional to your investment of 10% of the above mentioned profits.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">When the App TecniFull arrives in your country you will become a shareholder of the company and, therefore, you will no longer belong to the Members Club. As a shareholder, proportional to your investment in the ICO, you will be guaranteed a profit that will be distributed to all TecniFull shareholders in your country.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">The member of the Member Club who leaves the Club to become a shareholder will no longer participate in the general 10% distribution to be distributed among the members of the club.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">With this it is clear that the FullCoin Member Club is a transitory tool, while TecniFull is installed worldwide.</p>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><strong>DEBIT CARD</strong></h1>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">We want to bring the technology of the cryptocoins closer to our daily life. And the best way we could do that was by simplifying the collection of the profits from investing in our ICO. For this reason, we would like to introduce our debit card, with which you can exchange your FullCoin Tokens for money from your country.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">This service will be progressively extended to different countries.</p>

<p></p>

<center><img alt=""e0dc1b3673e2eab.png"" src=""https://www.kickico.com/assets/_images/77921/e0dc1b3673e2eab.png"" style=""width:300px;height:200px;""></center>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><strong>DISCOUNT CARD</strong></h1>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">We wanted to go further and establish win-win business relationships. For this reason, we have devised a system of discounts, with which you can purchase products and services from our affiliates for a lower price. Most importantly, you will both receive points for using this card that can then be exchanged for FullCoin tokens.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">In this way, our affiliates and our consumers will be ensuring a win-win relationship. Both will receive prizes for their use of the discount system.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><strong>WAYS TO WIN WITH FULLCOIN</strong></h1>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Here is a concise summary of the different ways our investors will earn money with the purchase of the Fullcoin token:</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">1.- Buying the FullCoin token, as it will be in the main exchange platforms.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">2.- Discounts when buying. Upon receiving our FullCoin discount card our investors will be able to purchase products and services in our network of businesses and affiliated companies and in the App TecniFull.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">3.- Getting Points. In addition to the discounts you will get when purchasing products and services in our network of businesses and affiliated companies and in our App TecniFull, you will accumulate points for each payment you make. These points will later be exchanged for FullCoins.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">4.- Affiliate Program. For every customer you refer to purchase the FullCoin token, you get a 10% bonus on the value of their purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><b>ECONOMICS OF THE TOKEN</b></h1>

<p></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">The FullCoin Token is created to help crypto currencies be useful in the small economy (microeconomics) and for this we will create a points system through which customers will receive rewards in points, in the affiliated businesses where they buy and when requesting services in our App TecniFull. These points can be exchanged for the token on the FullCoin web platform.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">The token is developed under the decentralized Ethereum’s blockchain (ERC20) and will be available on the various platforms of the most important Exchanges in the world of crypto coins.</p>

<h1 style=""text-align:center;""><u><strong>How it works</strong></u></h1>

<h2><strong><img alt=""3ab314c1a993288.png"" src=""/assets/_images/62920/3ab314c1a993288.png""></strong></h2>

<h3><u><strong><big>Players control everything</big></strong></u></h3>

<p><br>
Absolutelly all games, card tables, poker rooms, tournaments, slot machines, lotteries, etc. in casino are controlled by the players themselves. Each game is hosted by a certain player.</p>

<h3><u><big><strong>Game leasing</strong></big></u></h3>

<p>This player determines parameters of the game or tournament he is hosting and becomes the owner of the game for the time being. Let's say, each game is leased to one of the players for a nominal fee.</p>

<h3><u><big><strong>Daily drawings</strong></big></u></h3>

<p>The easiest way to give each user the opportunity to become the owner of the game is drawing of the lots. Drawings are held automatically. The winner should pay a small fee in URUN tokens to confirm his/her right to own the game.</p>

<h3><u><big><strong>Monitoring &amp; Moderation</strong></big></u></h3>

<p>During this lease, the owner of the game not only monitors what is going on, but also performs basic functions of a moderator.</p>

<h3><u><big><strong>Profit</strong></big></u></h3>

<p>At the end of this period, the owner of the game receives most of the profit generated during his lease.</p>

<h3><u><big><strong>Player's rank</strong></big></u></h3>

<p>The more often the user plays and the bigger his bets, the higher is his rank. And the higher is the player's rank, the more chances he has to become the owner of the game.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align:center;""><u><big><strong>More Awesome Features</strong></big></u></h2>

<p></p>

<h2 style=""text-align:center;""><u><strong>This is the First Gambling Platform with Constantly Decreasing Amount of Tokens</strong></u></h2>

<p><img alt=""9d565e19bb1c260.png"" src=""/assets/_images/62920/9d565e19bb1c260.png""></p>

<p>URUN tokens issued during the ICO are the only tokens which will be issued by&nbsp;<strong>U Run It</strong>. No URUN tokens will be issued after ICO.</p>

<p>0.5% of every transactions when paying for the services on the platform made in URUN tokens is ""burnt"". Consider URUN tokens as ""fuel"" for the platform transactions processing. This ""burning process"" is regulated by smart contracts on the blockchain.<br>
It means the number of URUN tokens available will constantly decrease.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align:center;""><u><strong>Why should you buy URUN tokens?</strong></u></h2>

<h3><u><strong>Limited offer</strong></u></h3>

<p>URUN Smart Contract through the decentralized blockchain protocol ensures that only certain number of URUN tokens will be issued during ICO. There will be no more issues of tokens after the ICO.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Jackpot drawings</strong></u></h3>

<p>Every token holder can participate in our daily, weekly and monthly jackpot drawings. 70% of all tokens collected by the platform will be used for jackpot drawings.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Compliance with regulations</strong></u></h3>

<p>We have taken professional advice from the best lawyers specializing in finance cryptocurrency regulations. URUN token is clearly a utility token, not a security. This means fast listing on exchanges after the ICO.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Constant demand for tokens</strong></u></h3>

<p>URUN tokens are required to use U Run It platform, but the number of tokens circulation will constantly decrease. URUN tokens are used as ""fuel"" for all the transactions within the platform, and with every transaction a small number of tokens is ""burnt"" (they are taken out of circulation). However, in the same time the number of casino operators using our platform as well as overall number of players using URUN tokens will grow exponentially. Therefore, the demand for URUN tokens will constantly increase.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Technical excellence</strong></u></h3>

<p>Not only the programmers who developed our URUN smart contract, have over 3 years of experience in blockchain solutions, but also high quality and security of this smart contract was confirmed by the technical audit conducted by the best specialists in blockchain security.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""><strong>FLUX – </strong>the unique decentralized gaming platform, uniting all stakeholders of the gaming industry. Gamers, vendors, the community, investors and item traders will be able to transform their time spent with games into a profit, by streamlining the complete gaming industry value chain and giving the power back to those who create the value. FLUX provides all needed elements to initiate a horizontal disruption. We bring the relationship between the participants into a correct digital process, make it transparent, automated, impossible to manipulate, and furthermore beneficial to all. FLUX is a full-fledged ecosystem, a reliable base and instruments to leverage the existing values the right way. FLUX will have a real token economy, where the value of the platform is driven by transparent multi cross interactions and not a bilateral ""trade"".&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""><img alt=""64d5f1d247a9765.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/66749/64d5f1d247a9765.png""></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">The team of FLUX creators includes professionals with deep practical experience in e-sports, game industry, digital television, media, blockchain technologies, and has an excellent practical understanding of market structure, consumer behavior, conversion attraction models.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""><img alt=""43e04202f39770b.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/66749/43e04202f39770b.png""><img alt=""8c063aac4668352.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/66749/8c063aac4668352.png""></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""><strong>“FLUX unites two huge industries (crypto and gaming) and benefits both. The gaming industry is one of the fastest developing industries in the world, but nevertheless its potential is much larger than it seems.”</strong> says FLUX CEO Alexandr Sushko, <strong>“We see blockchain and crypto currency in conjunction with competently built ecosystem for gamers as an excellent solution for the industry.""</strong> The FLUX economy assumes absolute transparency, absence of boundaries, and its own token (FLUX) will be the main means of payment within the ecosystem. Leading professionals are among the partners of the project. Our partners are:<strong> Infopulse, Remme, MoxyOne, SinceTv, Axon Partners, Ambisafe, Provectus</strong>. The project has already reached the softcap of <strong>$2.3 million</strong>. The team has managed to release the <strong>Alpha Desktop build before the Token Sale</strong>. FLUX invites everyone to test the Alpha build that includes Bang! game and all features of the future full release except payment that will be added on April 17.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""><img alt=""637405bba9c258c.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/66749/637405bba9c258c.png""></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""><strong>FLUX Master Nodes</strong></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">The FLUX master nodes system is created to make FLUX crowdfunding system fully decentralized and trustworthy. This is the best way to give any contributor an opportunity to have a vote in the crowdfunded games selection and receive handling fees for transactions and operations. To get a FLUX master node, there has to be 5 000 FLUX in the contrubutor’s wallet. We are willing to give everyone an opportunity to get a master node, hence the team decided to implement a limitation system for Whitelist contributors as their number is overwhelming! The FLUX master nodes system allows any nodeholder to become a part of the FLUX gaming ecosystem, participate in the crowdfunding platform, vote for projects and receive handling fees for operational work that master node is processing. Each nodeholder has a ""fee portfolio"" - a list of projects (games) they get the rewards from. Thus, the more crowdfunding projects the nodeholders support, the greater the fee they receive. The nodeholders are always interested in the quality and the number of projects that they have supported, which allows the crowdfunding platform to evolve and get bigger. The paid matchmaking of competitive games will become the most prioritized because it will involve transactions most often, hence, nodeholders will get the highest fee from them.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""><img alt=""5c2946b21c4b35c.png"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/assets/_images/66749/5c2946b21c4b35c.png""></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""><strong>How the Master Nodes system works </strong></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">1) A game developer submits a project (game) to the FLUX crowdfunding platform, in which he indicates the necessary amount of funds to develop the project, payment periods, and variations of project development depending on the amount of funds collected.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">2) FLUX manually validates the application (excludes applications with adult content, checks the payment order, etc), and creates a standardized smart contract with a unique address. The payment logic is defined in the smart contract: the maximum number of tokens that can be sent to the contract, and the terms of the following voting rounds.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">3) The project appears in the list of projects available for voting on the crowdfunding platform.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">4) The project that receives the highest number of votes (tokens) receives a payment not only from the nodeholders, but also from the FLUX fund. The funds will be unlocked according to the project roadmap.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">5) After the project has fulfilled (or failed to fulfill) the first stage of crowdfunding, nodeholders vote to extend the funding. If 50% + of the holders vote for continuation of project support, the following amount is unlocked in the smart contract. If not, then all funds in the smart contract are distributed among the holders in proportion to the amount of the contribution to the project. 6) A smart contract is generated for each game launched via the crowdfunding platform. The contract then sends a portion of the handle fee from the paid matchmaking to the nodeholders who participated in the funding of the game.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""><strong>Business Opportunities and Interaction </strong></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">In terms of business, FLUX is a multipurpose tool, and not a service for solving one or more specific tasks. It is an independent game content generator and a potential partner for other e-sports platforms. With its help, it is possible to constantly integrate new products and attract as many partners as possible who will interact with the audience with the help of a blockchain technology.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">FLUX will open up new possibilities for beginners and for well-known developers, streamers and non-professional players, as well as pave the way to the “big league” for a huge number of little-known and medium-sized gaming disciplines. The FLUX ecosystem is built around the game process. While the players compete among themselves and generate their prize money in the game using the Matchmaking platform, and also buy/sell items related to the game, using the FLUX trading platform, or buying goods in the FLUX store, the developer (Game Creator) that uploaded and verified their game on the developer market, FLUX receives a portion of the fee taken by the platform from transactions and bets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">If the Game Creator has raised funds to create this game using the FLUX crowdfunding platform, some of its income is also distributed among contributors due to masternode system. The whole ecosystem is built using a system of multiple smart contracts, so all the described actions are handled automatically. With the help of blockchain technology and smart contracts, the whole process becomes as transparent and automated as possible, which makes the platform a strong extension of the existing industry and enables the use of crypto currency in real business.</p>
